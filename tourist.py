#The Boredless Tourist
#Project from Codecademy computer science pathway

#Now let’s create some data that we’re going to use to test the functionality that we create for The Boredless Tourist.
#The first is our list of destinations that we’re going to be using.

# List of destinations
destinations = ["Paris, Frace","Shanghai, China","Los Angeles, USA","Sao Paulo, Brazil","Cairo, Egypt"]

#Test traveller to see if functionality is working
test_traveller = ['Erin Wilkes','Shanghai, China', ['historical site', 'art']]
# "This is a traveler (a user of The Boredless Tourist application) whose name is Erin Wilkes who likes ...
# historical buildings and art. Erin is in China right now, hopefully we can find some good places to show her."
